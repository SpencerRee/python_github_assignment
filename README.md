# Students Weekly Study Time

This repository holds the code for a basic python code used to gather the daily study time for a student. It will convert the input into a integer float, and use that to calculate what the total hours studying for the week will be. If the Student doesn't input an integer it will simply ask the student to try again with a valid number.

## How to Run the Program

python app.py

# or

python3 app.py

Enter hours studied today: 2
Great! If you study 2 hours daily, you'll study 14 hours this week!
